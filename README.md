This database contains Polling Stations for Pakistan General Election in 2013 and 2018. 

General Election 2018

General Election 2013
1. National Assembly 
2. Punjab Assembly
3. Sindh Assembly 
4. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly
Unfortunately, the polling stations data for the Baluchistan Assembly is missing. 

I have tried to convert most of the PDF data to the CSV. However, some scanned PDF files could not be converted. If anyone is able to convert them, please share the result so it can be updated here too. 

Additionally, there is a lot of missing Districts in the Polling Stations data which I could not find yet.  

Things that needs to be done: 
1. Translate to Urdu
2. Connect PS in different elections
3. Add/identify Block Codes
4. Combine with PS results
5. Study voting patterns in an areas
